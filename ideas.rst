What's this?
------------
Instead of using the issues/ticket functionality of GitHub, I'd rather have a short list of ideas that might be integrated into the script at some time.


Priority "Would love to have that in"
-------------------------------------
- asking for the package name that should be packaged into this distribution (and it's git repo URL so it can be directly hooked in as a submodule)
- asking for the Distribution name to build
✔ asking whether the Admin-Package should be integrated and activated
- instead of using the current folder script should as for the target directory


Priority "May be"
-----------------
- send a nice greeting message to the author whenever this script is run :-)
- asking for the FLOW3 release (tag name) that should be taken to build the distribution instead of HEAD
